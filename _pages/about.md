Hi! I'm Julian from Sacramento, CA. I am a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engineer with a strong foundation in computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. My professional journey has been driven by my fascination with language, cognition, and computation, where I have had the privilege to design and develop cutting-edge AI-driven solutions for complex challenges in text analysis, [authorship detection](https://github.com/clu-ling/dugmore-detector/tree/julian-rambob/src/clu/authorship), and [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/julianrambob/sarcasm-detection-project). I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Human Language Technology at the University of Arizona, and will graduate in May 2025. Through this program, I am gaining deep insights into data science, machine learning, and AI development, particularly within the NLP space.

Over the years, I have honed my expertise in developing NLP pipelines and have worked extensively with state of the art machine learning tools and frameworks such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and NLTK. My experience extends to programming languages including Python, C++, and C#, allowing me to approach problems from both a software engineering and linguistic perspective. I have a proven track record through my experience as a research assistant of leveraging linguistic data annotation, transformer-based models, and statistical analysis to drive impactful research and product development.

## AI & NLP Vision

I am deeply motivated by the potential of AI to revolutionize how humans interact with technology, and my professional vision is centered on advancing AI-driven language technologies that bridge the gap between human communication and machine intelligence. By combining my background in linguistics with expertise in machine learning and cognitive science, I aim to create innovative solutions that address complex NLP challenges such as authorship detection, sentiment analysis, and intelligent systems.

My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of machine learning, computational linguistics, and AI development to contribute to groundbreaking research and real-world applications in natural language processing. I believe that by advancing models that can understand, generate, and analyze human language, we can improve how machines interpret and respond to human input in more meaningful and intuitive ways. As an aspiring NLP engineer, I am eager to contribute to innovations that enhance human-computer interaction and shape the future of AI-driven communication.

I am particularly passionate about the application of large language models (LLMs) and transformer-based architectures in NLP, as they have shown immense potential in understanding context and generating human-like text. In my current research, I am working on authorship detection, developing AI models that not only analyze text for style and structure but also leverage LLM-generated synthetic data to train models that mimic authorial styles. I am excited about the future of AI in NLP and look forward to contributing to advancements that enable more sophisticated, ethical, and impactful AI systems.

If you're also passionate about NLP, AI, or anything related to language technology and its powerful applications, let's connect. I’m always excited to collaborate, discuss, and learn more from others in the field.
